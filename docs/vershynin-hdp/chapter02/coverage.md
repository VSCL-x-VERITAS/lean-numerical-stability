It contains 130 source rows under gate schema 2.

## Status legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PROVED` | A Lean declaration states the printed row and has complete faithfulness evidence. |
| `REUSED` | Closed by an existing Mathlib/repository result plus a wrapper and a strength/domain audit. |
| `DISCREPANCY` | The printed claim is wrong; closed only by a formal witness **and** a separately named corrected result. |
| `WEAKENED` | The printed claim was never proved and proof search attained strictly less; the printed form stays a standing open item. |
| `READY` / `IN_PROGRESS` | Locally actionable work remains — including missing proofs, foundations, wrappers, audits and organization. |
| `HARD_BLOCKED` / `DEPENDENCY_BLOCKED` | A typed obstruction that cannot be resolved locally. Both bar `PASS`. |
| `SKIPPED` | Genuinely narrative, empirical, machine-specific or underspecified material, with a fixed reason code. |
| `DEFERRED` | Tracked to a named destination. |

## Gate-derived progress

- Chapter verdict: **ACTIVE** (not `PASS`).
- Formalized objects: **1**.
- Remaining objects: **118**.
- Denominator: **119**. Percentage: **0.84%**.
- Reported separately and excluded from the denominator: **11** skipped, **0** deferred.
- Status counts: `PROVED`=1, `READY`=118, `SKIPPED`=11.
- No row is `UNCLASSIFIED`. Weakened rows: 0. Discrepancy rows: 0.

**Why compiling Lean alone does not count as coverage.** A row becomes a
formalized object only when it also carries per-row faithfulness evidence: a
`contract_hash` and the three independent views, with `direct_pass` = `PASS`.
Compilation proves the Lean type is inhabited; it does not prove the type matches
the printed row. Exercise 2.8.5's accepted audit was invalidated by a later
change to the shared Bernstein source file and restored only after regenerated
packets matched the original audited hashes exactly and complete validation
passed against the new file hash.

## Rows carrying Lean content (76 of 130)

These have compiling, axiom-clean declarations and are blocked only on the
semantic-equivalence loop.
