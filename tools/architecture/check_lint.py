"""Enforce a machine-readable Batteries lint baseline with a review-only ratchet.

This is the lint counterpart of ``check_warnings.py``.  It consumes the captured
output of Batteries' ``runLinter`` (``lake lint`` once the lint driver is
declared, or ``lake exe runLinter NumStability``), reconstructs every finding
as a line-independent fingerprint, and compares that census against a reviewed
baseline document.  New findings fail; resolved findings also fail, so the
ceiling can only move down through review.  Only the Python standard library
is used.

Identity never involves the reported line or column.  A finding is identified
by

    (linter, repo-relative path, fully-qualified declaration name,
     normalized message head, occurrence index within that group)

The declaration name is the stable anchor: editing a file shifts every line
below the edit, but ``runLinter`` names the declaration it is complaining
about, and that name survives reflowing, reordering, and unrelated edits in
the same file.  Lines and columns are recorded as evidence only.
