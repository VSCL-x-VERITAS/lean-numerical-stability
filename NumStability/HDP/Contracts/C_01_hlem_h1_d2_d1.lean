/-!
Stable Chapter 1 forwarding module for Lemma 1.2.1 (the layer-cake identity).

The semantic producer is `layerCakeExpectation`; this leaf exposes the single
source-facing alias for the numbered row. A second, byte-identical alias
(`hdp_01_hlem_h1_d2_d1`) previously stood alongside the one below with the same
statement and the same proof term; it had no consumer anywhere in the
repository and was removed as a duplicate semantic wrapper, leaving one
canonical producer and one source-facing wrapper.
