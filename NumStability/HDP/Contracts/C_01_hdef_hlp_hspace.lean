Cross-split stable API for `HDP-01-DEF-LP-SPACE`.

This leaf states the source's finite-norm membership criterion for measurable
representatives.  The reusable producer also owns the standard
almost-everywhere quotient, but the audited theorem does not attribute that
unstated quotient convention to the printed set-builder.

`L^p` is exactly finiteness of the extended `L^p` norm. -/
