Cross-split stable API for `HDP-01-DEF-EXPECTATION-VARIANCE`.

The semantic producer owns the Bochner-integral definitions and centered
variable lemma; this leaf forwards the integrable probability-space model.

Section 1.1 prints the two quantities

  `E X`   and   `Var(X) = E(X - E X)^2`,

and its footnote 1 states that `E X` *is, by definition, the Lebesgue integral
of the function `X : Ω → ℝ`*.  The printed passage fixes no exceptional-value
convention for a non-integrable variable, so the source contract below is
stated on the module-owned finite-Lebesgue-integral definability domain
recorded in `module/instructions.md`: `Integrable X μ` for the ordinary
expectation and `MemLp X 2 μ` for the variance.  Those premises are exactly the
conditions that make the displayed real expressions meaningful; they are
declared meaning conditions, not proof conveniences.

Each printed quantity carries its own domain as a hypothesis of its own
conjunct, so neither clause is restricted by the other's domain.

/-- The book's Section 1.1 definitions of expectation and variance, read on the
declared finite-Lebesgue-integral definability domain.

The first conjunct is footnote 1: on the integrable domain `E X` is the
Lebesgue integral of `X`.  The second conjunct is the printed formula
`Var(X) = E(X - E X)^2`, together with the fact that square-integrability makes
its outer expectation an ordinary finite Lebesgue integral rather than a
totalized value. -/
