Stable Chapter 1 forwarding module for Jensen's inequality.

Section 1.2 prints the inequality for a convex function `φ` as

  `φ(E X) ≤ E φ(X)`,

with no exceptional-value convention for the two ordinary expectations it
displays.  Following the module-owned finite-Lebesgue-integral definability
convention in `module/instructions.md`, this contract carries exactly the two
premises that make those displayed expectations well-defined real numbers,
`Integrable X μ` and `Integrable (fun ω => φ (X ω)) μ`.  They are the declared
meaning conditions of the printed statement, not proof conveniences, and no
hypothesis beyond them is imposed: convexity is taken on all of `ℝ`, as printed.
