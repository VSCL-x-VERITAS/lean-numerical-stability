A Higham-style abstract floating-point model.

Source: Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, 2nd ed.,
§1.1, equation (1.1), and §2.2, standard model (2.4).  We use the non-strict
formal variant `|δ| ≤ u` of Higham's usual `|δ| < u`.

Each primitive arithmetic operation satisfies:
`fl(x op y) = (x op y) * (1 + δ)`, with `|δ| ≤ u`.

The square-root operation is included because algorithms such as Householder
reflector construction and Cholesky factorization need it as a primitive
rounded operation.  Higham explicitly notes after (2.4) that the same standard
model is normally assumed for square root.  Its relative-error law is stated
only for nonnegative inputs, which is the mathematical domain of real square
root.

      This is not a consequence of the relative-error standard model above.
      It is included explicitly because tight recursive-summation constants use
      the first addition from zero as exact. -/

/-- Exact arithmetic viewed as an `FPModel` with an arbitrary nonnegative

This constructor is useful for route-elimination statements: since the abstract
model stores only `0 <= u`, any theorem that tries to derive a fixed numerical
cap on `u` from `FPModel` alone is false. -/

/-- No fixed unit-roundoff cap follows from the abstract `FPModel` structure.

The model only assumes `0 <= fp.u`.  Therefore any theorem that needs
`fp.u <= Ucap` must carry it as a floating-point/domain assumption or derive it
from a more concrete machine model. -/
