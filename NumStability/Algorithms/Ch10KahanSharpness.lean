# Ch10KahanSharpness (compatibility module)

Import-only module retained so existing imports of `NumStability.Algorithms.Ch10KahanSharpness`
keep resolving. Every declaration moved unchanged to the canonical
modules imported above. The module's own original imports are
re-stated so consumers reaching an identifier transitively through
this path still see the same surface.
