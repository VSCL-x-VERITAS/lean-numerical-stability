# Coordinate-direction finite-volume splitting

This file gives source-independent data for an ordered fractional-step sweep.
The grid carries an actual finite-volume partition whose cells are coordinate
boxes in either physical or logical coordinates. A directional solver acts
on cell averages, and execution records the intermediate state before every
in-turn solve.

/-- A finite, nonempty, exhaustive family of coordinate directions together
with a chosen sweep order. The order is data: this structure imposes no
distinguished first direction. -/

/-- Coordinate data witnessing the two grid geometries used by dimensional
splitting. In the rectangular case the physical point space itself is the
Cartesian coordinate space. In the logically rectangular case an arbitrary
physical point space is related to that Cartesian space by an invertible
logical-coordinate chart. -/

/-- A rectangular or logically rectangular finite-volume grid.

Besides a coordinate chart, the structure records a measurable disjoint cell
partition, positive coordinate widths, and the fact that each cell really is
a box in those coordinates. Thus the geometry constructors are not merely
labels. -/
