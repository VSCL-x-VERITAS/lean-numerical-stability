-- Higham, Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms, 2nd ed.,
-- Chapter 16.2, equation (16.9), p. 308: assembly of the overall normwise
-- residual guarantee for the Sylvester solution computed by the Schur
-- (Bartels-Stewart) method.
--
-- The printed argument has three ingredients:
--   (i)  the rounded quasi-triangular solve residual, equations
--        (16.7)-(16.8), p. 308: the computed Schur-coordinate solution
--        `Y` satisfies `||Cs - (R Y - Y S)||_F <= gamma * (||R||_F +
--        ||S||_F) * ||Y||_F` with `Cs = U^T C V`;
--   (ii) exact residual transport between Schur and original coordinates
--        (proved in `Higham16.lean`:
--        `sylvesterResidualRect_schur_transform_identity`,
--        `frobNormRect_sylvesterResidualRect_schur_transform`);
--   (iii) Frobenius-norm invariance under the orthogonal factors, which
--        also converts the data scale `(||R||_F + ||S||_F) ||Y||_F` into
--        `(||A||_F + ||B||_F) ||Xhat||_F`.
--
-- This file proves the assembly steps (ii)+(iii) in full and packages the
-- resulting (16.9)-shaped guarantee.  Ingredient (i) is the concern of the
-- rounded triangular-solve module (`Higham16RoundedTriangular`), which does
-- not exist yet at the time of writing; its statement shape is therefore
-- taken as an explicit hypothesis (`hres` below) and documented as such in
-- every docstring.  No rounded-arithmetic fact is claimed as proved here.
--
-- The sharper variants additionally allow backward-perturbed (rounded)
-- Schur factors `A + dA = U R U^T` with an exactly orthogonal `U` and a
-- normwise-relative Frobenius bound on `dA`.  That is precisely the
-- backward-error contract shape that the Chapter 19 Householder QR analysis
-- proves for the QR factorization step
-- (`H19.Theorem19_4.householder_qr_backward_error` /
-- `H19.Theorem19_4.HouseholderQRBackwardError.exists_frobNormRect_perturbation_bound`);
-- the corresponding QR-algorithm real-Schur-decomposition backward-error
-- theorem is not yet formalized, so the factor-perturbation bounds also
-- remain hypotheses, stated in exactly that ch19 shape.

/-- Higham, 2nd ed., Chapter 16.2, equation (16.9), p. 308: overall
    normwise residual guarantee for the Schur-method Sylvester solution
    under supplied exact orthogonal Schur factors, with an arbitrary
    coefficient `c`.

    Hypothesis `hres` is the rounded quasi-triangular solve residual bound
    of equations (16.7)-(16.8), p. 308, in Schur coordinates:
    `||Cs - (R Y - Y S)||_F <= c (||R||_F + ||S||_F) ||Y||_F` with
    `Cs = U^T C V`.  The rounded-solve module that will discharge it
    (`Higham16RoundedTriangular`) is not yet available, so the bound is an
    explicit hypothesis; this theorem contributes the remaining printed
    content of (16.9): the residual and every Frobenius factor of the data
    scale transport exactly through the orthogonal Schur coordinates, so
    the identical bound holds in original coordinates for the reconstructed
    solution `Xhat = U Y V^T`.  The coefficient is preserved verbatim; in
    particular no specific printed constant is claimed. -/

-- (16.9) assembly: backward-perturbed (rounded) Schur factors
-- ============================================================

/-- Higham, 2nd ed., Chapter 16.2, equation (16.9), p. 308, sharper
    fully-rounded-factor variant with explicit coefficients: the Schur
    factors themselves are computed, so only backward-perturbed exact
    orthogonal factorizations `A + dA = U R U^T`, `B + dB = V S V^T` are
    available, with `||dA||_F <= epsA ||A||_F` and
    `||dB||_F <= epsB ||B||_F`.

    This is exactly the backward-error contract shape proved by the
    Chapter 19 Householder QR analysis for the QR factorization step
    (`H19.Theorem19_4.householder_qr_backward_error` composed with
    `H19.Theorem19_4.HouseholderQRBackwardError.exists_frobNormRect_perturbation_bound`);
    the QR-algorithm real-Schur backward-error theorem is not yet
    formalized, so `hdA`/`hdB` remain hypotheses in that shape.  Hypothesis
    `hres` is the rounded quasi-triangular solve residual bound of
    equations (16.7)-(16.8) in Schur coordinates for the perturbed data.

    Conclusion: the residual of `Xhat = U Y V^T` obeys the (16.9)-shaped
    bound with the per-matrix coefficients inflated from `c` to
    `c (1 + epsA) + epsA` and `c (1 + epsB) + epsB`; the inflation is exact
    first-order bookkeeping and no printed constant is claimed. -/

/-- Higham, 2nd ed., Chapter 16.2, equation (16.9), p. 308: gamma-class
    fully-rounded-factor form of the overall Schur-method residual
    guarantee.

    The rounded quasi-triangular solve of equations (16.7)-(16.8)
    contributes a `gamma fp kSolve` coefficient (hypothesis `hres`; the
    module proving it is not yet available), and each computed Schur factor
    contributes a `gamma fp kFactor` normwise-relative backward
    perturbation of the ch19 Theorem 19.4 contract shape (hypotheses
    `hdA`/`hdB`; a QR-algorithm Schur backward-error theorem is not yet
    formalized).  By Higham's Lemma 3.3 composition rule
    (`gamma_sum_le`), the assembled coefficient stays in the same gamma
    class with the explicitly larger index `kSolve + kFactor`:
    `||C - (A Xhat - Xhat B)||_F <=
       gamma (kSolve + kFactor) (||A||_F + ||B||_F) ||Xhat||_F`.
    No claim is made that `kSolve + kFactor` matches the printed
    `gamma_tilde` integer. -/

    coefficient proved in this repository
    (`H19.Theorem19_4.householder_qr_backward_error`, equation (19.11)).

    `gamma_tilde fp m m` unfolds to

    factorization `A + dA = Q Rhat`, while the QR-algorithm real-Schur
    similarity form is not yet formalized.  This wrapper documents and
    fixes the coefficient bookkeeping for that forthcoming composition. -/

-- (16.9) assembly: rounded RHS transform and reconstruction budgets
-- ============================================================

/-- Higham, 2nd ed., Chapter 16.2, equations (16.5) and (16.9), p. 308:
    overall residual bound for the Schur method when the transformed
    right-hand side and the reconstructed solution are also computed
    quantities.

    `Dhat` is the computed Schur-coordinate right-hand side, within `eC`
    (Frobenius) of the exact transform `U^T C V`; `Xhat` is the computed
    reconstruction, within `eX` (Frobenius) of the exact product
    `U Y V^T`; `hres` is the rounded quasi-triangular solve residual bound
    of equations (16.7)-(16.8) against `Dhat` (the module proving it is
    not yet available, so it is an explicit hypothesis).  The conclusion
    keeps the exact-arithmetic scale `||Y||_F` and adds the two transform
    budgets additively; no hypothesis on the signs of `c`, `eC`, `eX` is
    needed.  See the companion
    `frobNormRect_sylvesterResidualRect_le_computedScale_of_schur_residual_with_transform_budgets`

/-- Higham, 2nd ed., Chapter 16.2, equation (16.9), p. 308: printed
    computed-solution-scale display of the transform-budget residual
    bound.  The exact-arithmetic scale `||Y||_F` of
    `frobNormRect_sylvesterResidualRect_le_of_schur_residual_with_transform_budgets`
    is relaxed to `||Xhat||_F + eX` for the computed reconstruction
    `Xhat`, which requires `0 <= c`.  All rounded ingredients ((16.7)-(16.8)
    solve residual, RHS-transform budget, reconstruction budget) remain
    explicit hypotheses documented in the primary theorem. -/
