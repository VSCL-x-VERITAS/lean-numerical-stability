# Higham Chapter 23, Theorem 23.2: Strassen error bound

This module proves the exact nonlinear bound for the literal recursive
Strassen evaluator, separates its first-order coefficient and quadratic
remainder, and derives the closed coefficient stated in Theorem 23.2.
-/

/-- Theorem 23.2 at exact nonlinear radius.  Unlike the scalar recurrence
surface, this theorem is proved by induction over the actual recursively
rounded Strassen evaluator. -/
