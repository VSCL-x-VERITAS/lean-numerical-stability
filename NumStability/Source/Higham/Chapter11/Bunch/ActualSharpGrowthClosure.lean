# Algorithm 11.1 actual-trace adapter for Bunch's sharp growth comparison

`Higham11ExactBunchTrace.toSharpBlocks` extracts every analytic block field
from the literal complete-search, symmetric-permutation, and Schur recursion
of Algorithm 11.1.  In particular, neither determinant acceptance nor local
growth is supplied by a caller.

The one remaining imported mathematical fact is isolated in
`Higham11BunchCertifiedExecution.wholeBlockSegmentHadamard`: every nonempty
*contiguous list of complete pivot blocks* satisfies the determinant identity
followed by Hadamard's inequality.  This is a finite structural witness about
pivot-block determinants.  It is not a stage-ratio, element-growth, or sharp
comparison premise.
