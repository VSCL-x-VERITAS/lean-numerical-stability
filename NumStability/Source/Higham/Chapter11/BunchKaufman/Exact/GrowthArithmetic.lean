# Exact-arithmetic completion for the literal Bunch--Kaufman producer

The rounded execution is also an exact execution when its floating-point
model has unit roundoff zero and every primitive is interpreted exactly.
This module proves that the total producer cannot take its explicit
two-by-two breakdown branch in that model.  The proof uses the nonsingularity
of the pivot selected by Algorithm 11.2, rather than assuming completion.
