A concrete obstruction to the dimension-independent `gamma_1` forward premise
in the printed tridiagonal-GEPP `gamma_6` assembly.  The literal three-by-three
executor below takes two consecutive adjacent pivots.  Its conventional
accumulated lower factor has last row `[1/2, -101/400, 1]`, while the associated
RHS accumulator passes through two rounded subtractions.  The final theorem
proves that no perturbation bounded by `gamma_1 |M|` can satisfy the accumulated
forward equation.  The model also satisfies `gammaValid fp 6`.
