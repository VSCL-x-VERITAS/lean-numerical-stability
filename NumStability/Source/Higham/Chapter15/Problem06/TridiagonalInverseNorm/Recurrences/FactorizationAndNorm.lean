# FactorizationAndNorm

Canonical destination for the frozen declaration block of
`NumStability.Algorithms.LU.Higham15Problem15_6Closure`, routed by wave R02 of the August 2026 repository reorganization
completion phase. Declaration names, kinds, visibilities, signatures and
proofs are unchanged; only the module they live in has changed. Private
declarations keep their logical names and are re-mangled against this module,
exactly as recorded in the reviewed private normalization.

# Higham15Problem15_6Closure (compatibility module)

Historical path, retained so existing imports of `NumStability.Algorithms.LU.Higham15Problem15_6Closure`
keep resolving. Most of its declarations moved unchanged to the
canonical modules imported above.

The declarations still defined below are private declarations and
their users. Lean mangles a private name to
`_private.<module>.<n>.<name>`, so relocating one renames it and
breaks the frozen declaration graph; anything referring to one must
therefore stay with it. This module is a declaration-bearing facade,
not a pure import shim.

/-- **Higham Problem 15.6, source-hypothesis closure.**

For the actual inverse of a nonempty nonsingular irreducible tridiagonal
matrix, the literal forward/backward scalar recurrences produce Higham's
upper-triangle factors `x` and `y`.  The two scan recurrences then compute
`|A⁻¹|d` and its infinity norm exactly for every `d ≥ 0`.  The same endpoint
records both the exact nontrivial-dimension scalar-operation count and its
uniform linear bound.

No inverse-entry formula, recurrence correctness, rank-one conclusion, or
complexity conclusion is supplied as a premise. -/
