Algorithms/HighamChapter8FanInClosure.lean

Fresh strict-audit closure for the exact inverse-column-factor part of
Higham (8.13)--(8.20), together with an honesty certificate showing that the
global all-orders envelope cannot itself be rewritten as the printed local
first-order five-factor envelope.

/-- **Honesty certificate for the fresh `(8.15)` audit.**  Even when all seven
`M_k` are the literal exact inverses of the source column factors, the global
all-orders absolute envelope cannot be reduced pointwise to the printed
five-factor first-order cube: at entry `(7,1)` the two matrices are `32` and
`24`.  Higham's source does not assert this false reduction; it expands the
local perturbations first and sends their cross terms to `O(u²)`. -/
