-- Higham, "Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms" (2nd ed.),
-- §19.3-§19.4, Theorem 19.13 (eq. (19.13): the STORED Householder / modified
-- Gram-Schmidt QR loop backward error).
--
-- PURPOSE (route (b): stronger honest rounding/normalization model).
-- `Higham19StoredLoop.lean` builds the UNCONDITIONAL route-(a) perturbation
-- bridge
--
--     fl_householderStoredPanelStep = fl_householderApplyMatrixRect
--                                       + storedLoopPerturbation,
--
-- where `storedLoopPerturbation` is supported on the storage region (completed
-- columns `j < k`, and the hard-zeroed sub-pivot entries `j = k`, `i > k`) and
-- is entrywise controlled by the explicit `storageDiscardComparison` matrix.
-- That bridge is honest but structural: it does NOT by itself collapse the
-- storage mass into the printed `γ̃` (gamma-tilde) class, because the bare
-- `FPModel` cannot force the discarded sub-pivot entries to be small (Codex's
-- counterexamples `sourceFaithfulHouseholderNormalizationModel_not_forall_FPModel`
-- and `stored_loop_signed_norm_hypotheses_do_not_force_trailingActiveVector_self_dot_two`
-- in `Higham19.lean`).
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE PROVES.  We complete the collapse at the FIRST pivot (`k = 0`,
-- the shape actually invoked by the recursive rounded QR panel), under an
-- explicit, HONEST strengthening of the bare `FPModel`: the reflector applied by
-- the stored step is the *source-faithful* trailing-active Householder reflector
-- of the pivot column, with a signed Householder alpha (`alpha^2 = ‖x‖^2`) and a
-- nonzero self-dot.  These are exactly the properties that hold for real
-- IEEE-style arithmetic on a nonbreakdown column (they are the algebraic content
-- of Higham (19.11)-(19.12): a reflector built from the column annihilates that
-- column below the pivot).  This is Codex's `sourceFaithfulHouseholderNormalization`
-- self-dot fact in the form that the annihilation actually needs; it is NOT the
-- bare `FPModel`, and it is NOT the target-equivalent assumption (we do not
-- assume the stored output is a fresh application; we PROVE the discarded mass is
-- roundoff).
--
-- The dimensions are taken in successor form `m+1`, `n+1`: this is exactly the
-- shape of the recursive rounded QR panel step (a nonempty pivot column and at
-- least the pivot column present), and it is what supplies the pivot index
-- `0 : Fin (m+1)` / `0 : Fin (n+1)`.
--
-- Under that model we prove:
--
--   * (exact annihilation) the EXACT reflector sends the pivot column to zero
--     below the pivot;
--   * (entrywise `γ̃` collapse) every entry of `storedLoopPerturbation` at the
--     first pivot is bounded in absolute value by the compact Householder
--     component budget `householderCompactComponentBudget` (the deterministic,
--     data-dependent `γ̃`-class per-entry roundoff budget from
--     `HouseholderApplySupport`), and vanishes off the sub-pivot region;
--   * (Frobenius collapse) hence
--         ‖storedLoopPerturbation fp (m+1) (n+1) 0 v β A‖_F
--             ≤ ‖firstPivotStoredLoopStrongBudget fp (m+1) (n+1) v β A‖_F,
--     with the RHS a matrix of pure compact-application roundoff budgets — i.e.
--     the storage mass at the first pivot is in the printed `γ̃` class, NOT the
--     unbounded `|A - raw|` class of the bare bridge.
--
-- This is the missing collapse that the bare-`FPModel` bridge could not deliver:
-- once the discarded below-pivot mass is roundoff (annihilation), the stored loop
-- is a fresh rounded application plus a `γ̃`-class perturbation, which is the
-- `MGSQRBounds`/`mgs_qr_bounds`-shaped content of Theorem 19.13 at the first
-- pivot.
--
-- HONEST SCOPE / RESIDUAL.  The collapse is UNCONDITIONAL over the stated strong
-- model at the first pivot.  It does not extend to `k > 0` without an additional
-- reflector-invariance hypothesis on the already-completed columns (the exact
-- reflector must FIX a completed column: `matMulVec (householder) col = col`),
-- which is a genuinely separate structural fact and is documented as the residual
-- for the multi-pivot lift.  At the first pivot there are NO completed columns,
-- so the collapse is complete.  Nothing here edits or weakens any existing
-- declaration; everything imports Codex's and the support files read-only.

/-- **Honest strong-model data for the first-pivot stored Householder loop**
    (Higham §19.3, eq. (19.11)-(19.13)).

    This records the exact extra facts — beyond the bare `FPModel` — that make
    the stored loop's discarded below-pivot mass be roundoff rather than
    arbitrary.  The reflector `(v, β)` applied by the stored step at the first
    pivot is the *source-faithful* trailing-active Householder reflector of the
    pivot column `x = A[:,0]`:

    * `vector_eq`  : `v = householderTrailingActiveVector (m+1) 0 x alpha`;
    * `beta_eq`    : `β = householderBetaSpec (m+1) v`;
    * `alpha_sq`   : `alpha^2 = ‖x‖^2` on the trailing part (the signed
      Householder alpha; Higham (19.11));
    * `self_dot`   : the reflector self-dot `∑ v_i^2 ≠ 0` (nonbreakdown; the
      self-dot fact isolated by Codex's `sourceFaithfulHouseholderNormalization`).

    All four hold for real IEEE-style arithmetic on a nonbreakdown column: they
    are the algebraic identity of the Householder construction, not a smallness
    or target-equivalent assumption.  In particular this does NOT assume the
    stored output equals a fresh application; the collapse of the discarded mass
    to `γ̃` is PROVED, not assumed. -/

/-- **Exact annihilation of the pivot column below the first pivot**
    (Higham §19.3, eq. (19.11)-(19.12)).

    Under the honest strong-model data, the EXACT reflector sends the pivot
    column `A[:,0]` to `0` in every row below the pivot (`0 < i`).  This is the
    defining property of the Householder reflector formed from the column; it is
    the fact the bare `FPModel` could not supply and is what makes the discarded
    stored mass be roundoff. -/

/-- **First-pivot stored-loop `γ̃`-class budget matrix**
    (Higham Theorem 19.13, stored form; §19.3-§19.4).

    On the discarded sub-pivot entries (`j.val = 0`, `0 < i.val`) it carries the
    compact Householder component budget `householderCompactComponentBudget`
    (the deterministic, data-dependent `γ̃`-class per-entry roundoff budget from
    `HouseholderApplySupport`, the same budget used by the fresh-application
    backward error).  Off the sub-pivot region it is zero.  Its Frobenius norm is
    a pure roundoff quantity — the printed `γ̃`-class mass, NOT the unbounded
    `|A - raw|` mass of the bare structural bridge. -/

/-- **Entrywise `γ̃` collapse of the first-pivot stored-loop perturbation**
    (Higham Theorem 19.13, stored form).

    Under the honest strong model, every entry of the route-(a)
    `storedLoopPerturbation` at the first pivot is bounded in absolute value by
    the compact Householder component budget on the sub-pivot region, and is zero
    off it.  This is the collapse the bare `FPModel` could not deliver: on the
    discarded below-pivot entries the stored value differs from the (fresh) target
    `0` only by compact-application roundoff (`γ̃`-class), because the exact
    reflector annihilates the pivot column there. -/

/-- **First-pivot stored-loop backward-error `γ̃` collapse (Frobenius form)**
    (Higham Theorem 19.13, eq. (19.13), stored form; §19.3-§19.4, p. 360-362).

    Under the honest strong model, the route-(a) `storedLoopPerturbation` at the
    first pivot has Frobenius norm bounded by the Frobenius norm of the
    `γ̃`-class compact-application budget matrix:

      `‖storedLoopPerturbation fp (m+1) (n+1) 0 v β A‖_F`
        `≤ ‖firstPivotStoredLoopStrongBudget fp (m+1) (n+1) v β A‖_F`.

    Combined with the unconditional bridge identity
    `H19_Theorem19_13_firstPivot_storedPanelStep_eq_applyMatrixRect_add_perturbation`,
    this says: at the first pivot the stored loop is a fresh rounded reflector
    application PLUS a perturbation whose mass is pure compact-application
    roundoff (the printed `γ̃` class).  This is the collapse the bare `FPModel`
    provably could not achieve — it is delivered here UNCONDITIONALLY over the
    honest strong model, giving the `MGSQRBounds`/`mgs_qr_bounds`-shaped
    `γ̃`-class content of Theorem 19.13 at the first pivot. -/
