/-- LeVeque's dimensional-splitting construction on a rectangular or
logically rectangular finite-volume grid.

The finite exhaustive direction list selects an arbitrary sweep order. The
one-dimensional high-resolution method supplies a positive fraction no larger
than one and a cell-average solve for every direction. The conclusion
constructs the resulting nonempty schedule, proves every coordinate direction
occurs with exactly its method data, and exposes the full in-turn execution
trace. No direction order, numerical fraction, flux formula, or neighboring
qualitative claim is fixed. -/
