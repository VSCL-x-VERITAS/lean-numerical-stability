# LeVeque Chapter 1, Equation (1.3): global scope

Randall J. LeVeque, *Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems*, Chapter 1,
printed page 1 (raw PDF page 23), equations (1.2)-(1.3). This declaration keeps
the source's arbitrary-profile propagation statement separate from the
regularity required by its classical PDE reading.

/-- Equation (1.3), with its two regularity scopes made explicit: every scalar
profile is transported unchanged, and a globally differentiable profile is a
classical solution of the scalar advection equation at every point. -/
